Flexible and intuitive build of [AlphaZero](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go).

Currently works out of the box for both ConnectFour and TicTacToe.

Use [main.py](https://github.com/foersterrobert/AlphaZero/blob/master/main.py) for training your own models.

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

Alternatively you can also use the pretrained models in the [Models](https://github.com/foersterrobert/AlphaZero/tree/master/Models) folder and test them in [test.ipynb](https://github.com/foersterrobert/AlphaZero/blob/master/test.ipynb).
