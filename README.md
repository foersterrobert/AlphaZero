Flexible and intuitive build of [AlphaZero](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go).

Currently works out of the box for both ConnectFour and TicTacToe.

Use main.py for training your own models.

Alternatively you can also use the pretrained models in the Models folder and test them in test.ipynb.
